        output: "Nuclear fusion is the process where atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. This is the same process that powers stars like our sun. In fusion, light elements like hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and tritium) are heated to extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees), causing them to overcome their natural electromagnetic repulsion and fuse together. This fusion releases significant energy because the mass of the resulting nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the original nuclei, with the difference converted to energy according to Einstein's E=mcÂ². While fusion promises clean, abundant energy, creating controlled fusion reactions on Earth remains challenging due to the extreme conditions required."

        input: "What are black holes?",
        output: "Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it passes the event horizon. They form when very massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle. Black holes are characterized by their event horizon (the boundary beyond which nothing can escape) and singularity (a point of infinite density at the center). They're detected through their effects on nearby matter and radiation rather than direct observation. Black holes come in different sizes: stellar black holes form from collapsed stars, while supermassive black holes exist at the centers of most galaxies, including our Milky Way. Recent advancements like the Event Horizon Telescope have allowed scientists to capture the first images of black hole shadows."
