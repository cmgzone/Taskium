# Netlify Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix deployment issues when hosting the TSK Platform frontend on Netlify while keeping the backend on Replit.

## Issues Fixed

1. **"Page not found" errors after page refresh**
2. **Missing backend connection in the deployed frontend**
3. **CORS restrictions when frontend and backend are on different domains**
4. **Limited offline functionality**

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Public Health Check Endpoint

Added a public health check endpoint that doesn't require authentication:

- Created `/server/routes/health-check.ts` with basic and DB health check endpoints
- Registered these routes in the main `routes.ts` file before auth middleware
- Frontend uses this endpoint to detect backend connectivity

### 2. API Configuration for Different Environments

Updated the API configuration to handle different deployment environments:

- Modified `/client/src/lib/api-config.ts` to use the Replit backend URL in production
- Implemented the `buildApiUrl` helper function to handle URL construction
- Added a `BackendStatusAlert` component to notify users about backend connectivity issues

### 3. SPA Routing for Netlify

Implemented proper Single Page Application (SPA) routing for Netlify:

- Created `client/public/_redirects` file with the rule `/* /index.html 200`
- Updated `netlify.toml` with redirect rules for SPA routing
- Modified `netlify-build.sh` to ensure _redirects file is included in the build output

### 4. CORS Configuration for Cross-Domain Requests

Added CORS configuration to the Express server to accept requests from the Netlify domain:

- Installed the `cors` package and its type definitions
- Configured CORS in `server/index.ts` with appropriate origins, methods, and headers
- Set `credentials: true` to allow cookie-based authentication across domains

### 5. Offline Support Improvements

Enhanced offline support for the PWA:

- Created a proper `offline.html` page for the service worker to use when offline
- Added it to both the client and public directories
- Updated the service worker to handle offline scenarios better

### 6. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for deployment and troubleshooting:

- Created `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` with detailed deployment instructions
- Added this `NETLIFY_FIXES.md` document to summarize the changes made

## Configuration Files Modified

1. **netlify.toml**: Configuration file for Netlify builds
2. **netlify-build.sh**: Build script for Netlify deployment
3. **client/public/_redirects**: SPA routing rules for Netlify
4. **client/src/lib/api-config.ts**: API URL configuration for different environments

## New Files Created

1. **/server/routes/health-check.ts**: Public health check endpoint
2. **/client/public/offline.html**: Offline fallback page
3. **/NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide
4. **/NETLIFY_FIXES.md**: Summary of fixes (this document)

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying to Netlify, verify that:

1. The frontend loads correctly at your Netlify domain
2. Page refreshes work on all routes without 404 errors
3. The backend connectivity status is correctly shown
4. API requests from the Netlify domain to the Replit backend work properly
5. Authentication works across domains

## Next Steps

1. **Custom Domain**: Consider setting up a custom domain in Netlify for a more professional appearance
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables in Netlify for any frontend configuration
3. **Monitoring**: Implement frontend error monitoring for production issues
4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing CDN caching for static assets

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that the TSK Platform can be deployed with the frontend on Netlify and the backend on Replit, giving you the benefits of both platforms while maintaining full functionality.
